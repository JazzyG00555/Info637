<h1>Apple Health: Menstrual Health Application Redesign</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="split-columns">


<div class="overviewtext">
<p>This project involves how we might redesign the Apple Health application for adult working women to be informed about their fertility cycles. We aim to provide an application with improved fertility information that will further fulfill the needs of adult working women in this particular area. We want to provide them with access to more diverse fertility information through the app, as this is a topic many women could benefit from in their daily lives. The following document goes through our primary and secondary research methods as well as the solutions developed during the making of our mental model. We will also be presenting three research models. This includes a persona, a scenario and a user journey to further develop who our user is and what their potential processes might be while using our redesigned application. We will then go over our specific design requirements for our redesigned application.</p>

<h2>Design Considerations</h2>


<h4>1. Efficient Tracking Method</h4>

<p>We want to ensure Apple Health’s tracking method becomes more labour-saving by turning it into a simpler process when logging cycle information. By doing this, we will make it more accessible and time efficient.</p>

<h4>2. Privacy and Security</h4>

<p>This revolves around privacy and security. We will be mindful of the lack of laws protecting those with uterus’ currently, and will be fully transparent with users about what happens with their data. Users will be the ones to choose if and who they would want to share their data with.</p>

<h4>3. Health and Medical Accuracy</h4>

<p>Health and medical accuracy is a priority as we want to focus on providing reliable educational content that will inform our users about their cycle, symptoms and fertility predictions accurately.</p>
</div>



<h2>Reflections</h2>

<h4>What went well</h4> 

<ul>
<li>We found that implementing and having separate Summary and Log tabs allowed for a clear and easy-to-read layout that many users commented on and gravitated to.</li>
<li>Within our usability tests, our Figma digital prototype allowed the users to have an interactive experience with the design. From doing this, we were able to visually see the user’s clicking patterns and receive valuable feedback to adjust within our redesign.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What did not work well</h4>

<ul>
<li>One of our biggest challenges was our observation, primarily because it did not match our design frame needs. Being within a medical space limited our ability to gauge behaviors since we were only allowed in the waiting room(s).</li>
<li>One thing we noticed within the Health Resources page was that users did not necessarily understand the subsections for our different features in this location. Our users, for instance, did not immediately understand the purpose of the medical location page or the mental health checks. This seemed to mostly be due to the wording or vocabulary of the way we named such options within our prototype.</li>
</ul>
