<p><b><i>Apple Health</i>: Menstrual Health Application Redesign</b></p>
    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
    
<p>How might we redesign the Apple Health application for adult working women to be informed about their fertility cycles?</p>
<p>We aim to deliver an application that provides better and more diverse access to fertility information since this is a topic many women would benefit from in their daily lives.</p>

<h2>Design Considerations</h2></div>

<div class="triple-column">

<div class="design-box">
<h3>1. Efficient Tracking Method</h3>
<p>A more labour-saving tracking method for logging cycle information. This creates more accessibility and time efficiency.</p>

</div>

<div class="design-box">
<h3>2. Privacy and Security</h3>
<p>Mindfulness towards the lack of current laws protecting those with a uterus, and maintain full transparency with users about what happens to their data.</p>

</div>

<div class="design-box">
<h3>3. Health and Medical Accuracy</h3>
<p>Prioritizing reliable educational content that informs users about their cycle, symptoms and fertility predictions accurately.</p>

</div>
</div>


 <h2>Feature Developments</h2>

<div class="prototype-column">


<ul>
<li>A more <b>detailed calendar view</b>, offering users an at-a-glance summary of their cycle,
symptoms, and ovulation predictions. This was designed to support better daily tracking
and provide contextual insights.</li>
<li>A new <b>Resources section</b>, which gives users access to curated, medically-sound articles
and tips related to menstrual and fertility health. This section would also include
resources informing users of how their data is being used within the application. </li>
<li>A <b>dedicated Fertility Tracking page</b>, which includes tools for logging ovulation,
pregnancy, fertility symptoms, and any related habits such as IVF tracking or temperature
charting.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Reflections</h2>

<div class="left-side">

<h3>What went well</h3> 
<h3>What did not work well</h3>

</div>


<div class="left-side">
<ul>
<li>Implementing Summary and Log tabs allowed for a clear and easy-to-read layout.</li>
<li>Could visually see users’ clicking patterns which allowed us to receive valuable feedback to further adjust our redesign. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Our observations did not match our design frame needs. Being within a medical space limited our ability to gauge behaviors since we were only allowed in the waiting room(s).</li>
<li>Users did not necessarily understand the subsections of the features in the Health Resources Page. This seemed to be mostly due to the vocabulary and how the options were named within our prototype.</li>
</ul>
