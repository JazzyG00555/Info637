<h1> Apple Health: Menstrual Health Application Redesign</h1>

<h2> Overview</h2>

<p>This project involves how we might redesign the Apple Health application for adult working women to be informed about their fertility cycles. 

We aim to provide an application with improved fertility information that will further fulfill the needs of adult working women in this particular area. We want to provide them with access to more diverse fertility information through the app, as this is a topic many women could benefit from in their daily lives. The following document goes through our primary and secondary research methods as well as the solutions developed during the making of our mental model. We will also be presenting three research models. This includes a persona, a scenario and a user journey to further develop who our user is and what their potential processes might be while using our redesigned application. We will then go over our specific design requirements for our redesigned application.</p>


<h2>Design Considerations</h2>


<p>After our data analysis and extensive research, we have come up with the following design considerations that we will be mindful of for our redesign of the Apple Health application for adult working women.

1) Efficient Tracking Method

We want to ensure Apple Health’ s tracking method becomes more labour-saving by turning it into a simpler process when logging cycle information. By doing this, we will make it more accessible and time efficient.

2) Privacy and Security

This revolves around privacy and security. We will be mindful of the lack of laws protecting those with uterus’ currently, and will be fully transparent with users about what happens with their data. Users will be the ones to choose if and who they would want to share their data with.

3) Health and Medical Accuracy

Health and medical accuracy is a priority as we want to focus on providing reliable educational content that will inform our users about their cycle, symptoms and fertility predictions accurately.</p>


<h2>Prototype</h2>

<p>The prototyping phase for the redesign of Apple Health involved creating better-developed tracking features for adult working women in regards to their fertility cycles. The goal of the features was to further help our users be informed about their fertility by creating four main centralized locations. This was accomplished by using our mid-fidelity wireframes and transforming them into a working interactive prototype on Figma. This was done to test out a realistic user experience of our potential redesign of Apple Health. It featured nine screens total, with seven of them being redesigned pages of the original application. 

This prototype first included a calendar page as it was redesigned to have all its fertility information on one calendar instead of on multiple. This page consisted of a place for our users to quickly check when the next eventful parts of their cycle may be happening next (ex: period or ovulation). We also put a “Add Period” button which our users can use to navigate directly to the logging period page in our prototype. The next two fertility information pages were the cycle tracking and fertility tracking pages. These two pages in the prototype were split in two by a summary and a log page. This was done to limit users' amount of scrolling in the app, so that the information they need appears immediately when selecting each tab. Each page consists of a small scrollable calendar at the top. This prototype then allows users to check their fertility information regarding their cycle length, period, their pregnancy chances or even their contraception information quickly and efficiently in the summary section. It then also allows each page to have an accessible dedicated logging section that is now much easier to find for users wishing to log their information quickly. The logging options within the prototype include period, symptoms, overall pain, fertility boosting, pregnancy and contraception. The last page was the health resources section, which provides users a potential place to register their medical ID, find medical locations, mental health checks and privacy information more efficiently. This page was created to ensure there is a section of the application where our users can have access to finding reputable medical professionals and articles regarding their menstrual health needs, whether it be mental or physical.</p>


<h2>Reflections</h2>

<p>Upon receiving feedback from our peers and professor, we aimed to improve our design in a way that adhered to Apple Health’ s design principles.

 ●What went well

1.) We found that implementing and having separate Summary and Log tabs allowed for a clear and easy-to-read layout that many users commented on and gravitated to. 

2.) Within our usability tests, our Figma digital prototype allowed the users to have an interactive experience with the design. From doing this, we were able to visually see the user’s clicking patterns and receive valuable feedback to adjust within our redesign.

●What did not work well

1.) One of our biggest challenges was our observation, primarily because it did not match our design frame needs. Being within a medical space limited our ability to gauge behaviors since we were only allowed in the waiting room(s).

2.) One thing we noticed within the Health Resources page was that users did not necessarily understand the subsections for our different features in this location. Our users, for instance, did not immediately understand the purpose of the medical location page or the mental health checks. This seemed to mostly be due to the wording or vocabulary of the way we named such options within our prototype.</p>
